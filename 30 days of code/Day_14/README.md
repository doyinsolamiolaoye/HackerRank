# Scope

## Problem Statement
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any `2` numbers in `N` and stores it in the `maximumDifference` instance variable.

**Input Format:**
You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in your editor reads in `2` lines of input; the first line contains `N` , and the second line describes the `elements` array.


**Sample Input**
```

1 2 5

**Sample Output**
