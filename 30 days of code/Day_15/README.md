# Linked Lists

## Problem Statement
Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass `data`  as the Node constructor argument) and inserts it at the tail of the linked list referenced by the `head` parameter. Once the new node is added, return the reference to the `head` node.

Note: If the `head` argument passed to the insert function is null, then the initial list is empty.

**Input Format**

The insert function has `2` parameters: a pointer to a Node named `head`, and an integer value, `data` .
The constructor for Node has `1` parameter: an integer value for the `data` field.

You do not need to read anything from stdin.

**Sample Input**
```
2
3
4
1
```

**Sample Output**
```
2 3 4 1
```
